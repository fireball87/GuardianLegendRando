things to maybe do

fix grimgrin health to make fighting only last phase grimgrins less likely

make the division library not put all the rooms in a spool, come out from the corners differently
    //design it so you NEVER enter areas through the edge of the ring
add something that looks at every door room and removes any trees beyond it that has nothing but regular rooms
    when i do this i should have it traverse, but be recursive when it hits branches
    i should also have it mark rooms as alive, so when you hit branches that are already stated to be alive, you know they are immediately
    also give an option to attempt to transfer fat zones to nonfat zones through non portals

add archtypes that can be randomly added to seeds
    tree
    maybe a hex grid

add other maze generators, that can flow into archtypes

boss randomization of course

weapon rebalance and/or weapon randimzation

skip c0 as an option, move c0 perhaps?

enemy pattern modifications
